## `Ruby`

The most boring language i have ever seen - 2/5

I don't want to have memory leaks, I don't want to have memory leaks, I don't want to have memory leaks - 3/5

## `F#`

Perfect combination FP with OOP - 5/5

Just more comfortable than C, interesting - 4/5

## `PHP`

Like Javascript, just don't like it, but I don't hate it either - 3/5
